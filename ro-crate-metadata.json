It supports both canonical base DNA and modified base calling, including specialized applications such as **Fiber-seq**.\n \nThis **end-to-end pipeline** handles the entire workflow \u2014 **from raw read processing and alignment, to comprehensive somatic variant calling**, including single nucleotide variants, indels, structural variants, copy number alterations, and modified bases. \n\nIt can be run in both **matched tumour-normal** and **tumour-only mode**, offering flexibility depending on the users study design.\n\nDeveloped using **Nextflow DSL2**, it offers high portability and scalability across diverse computing environments. By leveraging Docker or Singularity containers, installation is streamlined and results are highly reproducible. Each process runs in an isolated container, simplifying dependency management and updates. Where applicable, pipeline components are sourced from **nf-core/modules**, promoting reuse, interoperability, and consistency within the broader Nextflow and nf-core ecosystems.\n\n## Pipeline summary\n**1) Pre-processing:**\n\n   a. Raw read QC ([`cramino`](https://github.com/wdecoster/cramino))\n\n   b.\tAlignment to the reference genome ([`minimap2`](https://github.com/lh3/minimap2))\n\n   c. Post alignment QC ([`cramino`](https://github.com/wdecoster/cramino), [`samtools idxstats`](https://github.com/samtools/samtools), [`samtools flagstats`](https://github.com/samtools/samtools), [`samtools stats`](https://github.com/samtools/samtools))\n\n   d. Specific for calling modified base calling ([`Modkit`](https://github.com/nanoporetech/modkit), [`Fibertools`](https://github.com/fiberseq/fibertools-rs))\n\n**2i) Matched mode: small variant calling:**\n   \n   a. Calling Germline SNPs ([`Clair3`](https://github.com/HKU-BAL/Clair3))\n\n   b. Phasing and Haplotagging the SNPs in the normal and tumour BAM ([`LongPhase`](https://github.com/twolinin/longphase))\n\n   c. Calling somatic SNVs ([`ClairS`](https://github.com/HKU-BAL/ClairS))\n\n**2ii) Tumour only mode: small variant calling:**\n\n   a. Calling Germline SNPs and somatic SNVs ([`ClairS-TO`](https://github.com/HKU-BAL/ClairS-TO))\n\n   b. Phasing and Haplotagging germline SNPs in tumour BAM ([`LongPhase`](https://github.com/twolinin/longphase))\n\n**3) Large variant calling:**\n\n   a. Somatic structural variant calling ([`Severus`](https://github.com/KolmogorovLab/Severus))\n\n   b. Copy number alterion calling; long read version of ([`ASCAT`](https://github.com/VanLoo-lab/ascat))\n\n<!-- TODO nf-core: Include a figure that guides the user through the major workflow steps. Many nf-core\n     workflows use the \"tube map\" design for that. See https://nf-co.re/docs/guidelines/graphic_design/workflow_diagrams#examples for examples.   -->\n<!-- TODO nf-core: Fill in short bullet-pointed list of the default steps in the pipeline -->2. Present QC for raw reads ([`MultiQC`](http://multiqc.info/))\n\n## Usage\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> If you are new to Nextflow and nf-core, please refer to [this page](https://nf-co.re/docs/usage/installation) on how to set-up Nextflow. Make sure to [test your setup](https://nf-co.re/docs/usage/introduction#how-to-run-a-pipeline) with `-profile test` before running the workflow on actual data.\n\nFirst prepare a samplesheet with your input data that looks as follows:\n```csv\nsample,bam_tumor,bam_normal,platform,sex,fiber\nsample1,tumour.bam,normal.bam,ont,female,n\nsample2,tumour.bam,,ont,female,y\nsample3,tumour.bam,,pb,male,n\nsample4,tumour.bam,normal.bam,pb,male,y\n```\n\nEach row represents a sample. The bam files should always be unaligned bam files. All fields except for `bam_normal` are required. If `bam_normal` is empty, the pipeline will run in tumour only mode. `platform` should be either `ont` or `pb` for Oxford Nanopore Sequencing or PacBio sequencing, respectively. `sex` refers to the biological sex of the sample and should be either `female` or `male`. Finally, `fiber` specifies whether your sample is Fiber-seq data or not and should have either `y` for Yes or `n` for No. \n\nNow, you can run the pipeline using:\n\n```bash\nnextflow run IntGenomicsLab/lr_somatic \\\n   -profile <docker/singularity/.../institute> \\\n   --input samplesheet.csv \\\n   --outdir <OUTDIR>\n```\n\n> [!WARNING]\n> Please provide pipeline parameters via the CLI or Nextflow `-params-file` option. Custom config files including those provided by the `-c` Nextflow option can be used to provide any configuration _**except for parameters**_; see [docs](https://nf-co.re/docs/usage/getting_started/configuration#custom-configuration-files).\n\n## Credits\n\nIntGenomicsLab/lr_somatic was originally written by Luuk Harbers, Alexandra Pan\u010d\u00edkov\u00e1, Robert Forsyth, Marios Eftychiou, Ruben Cools, and Jonas Demeulemeester.\n\n## Pipeline output\n\nThis pipeline produces a series of different output files. The main output is an aligned and phased tumour bam file. This bam file can be used by any typical downstream tool that uses bam files as input. Furthermore, we have sample-specific QC outputs from `cramino` (fastq), `cramino` (bam), `mosdepth`, `samtools` (stats/flagstat/idxstats), and optionally `fibertools`. Finally, we have a `multiqc` report from that combines the output from `mosdepth` and `samtools` into one html report.\n\nBesides QC and the aligned and phased bam file, we have output from (structural) variant and copy number callers, of which some are optional. The output from these variant callers can be found in their respective folders. For small and structural variant callers (`clairS`, `clairS-TO`, and `severus`) these will contain, among others, `vcf` files with called variants. For `ascat` these contain files with final copy number information and plots of the copy number profiles.\n\nExample output directory structure:\n\n```\nresults\n|\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 multiqc\n\u2502\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 sample1\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 bamfiles\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 qc\n\u2502   \u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 tumour\n\u2502   \u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 normal\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 variants\n\u2502   \u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 severus\n\u2502   \u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 clairs\n\u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 ascat\n\u2502\n\u2514\u2500\u2500 sample2\n    \u251c\u2500\u2500 bamfiles\n    \u251c\u2500\u2500 qc\n    \u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 tumour\n    \u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 normal\n    \u251c\u2500\u2500 variants\n    \u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 severus\n    \u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 clairs\n    \u2514\u2500\u2500 ascat\n```\n\n## Contributions and Support\n\nIf you would like to contribute to this pipeline, please see the [contributing guidelines](.github/CONTRIBUTING.md).\n\n## Citations\n\n<!-- TODO nf-core: Add citation for pipeline after first release.
